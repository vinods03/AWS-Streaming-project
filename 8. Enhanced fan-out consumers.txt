Use the below command to register a consumer (orders-consumer-1) with the kinesis data stream:
aws kinesis register-stream-consumer --stream-arn arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:100163808729:stream/orders --consumer-name orders-consumer-1

Then, change the trigger of the lambda function to the stream + consumer instead of stream alone, as was the case earlier.

When you use this operation, the consumer you register can then call SubscribeToShard to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.
You can register up to 20 consumers per stream. A given consumer can only be registered with one stream at a time.

Basically, you can create another consumer (orders-consumer-2), register it with the kinesis data stream and have another lambda process data from the same stream and do something else.
The rate of 2 MiB per second remains the same for both the consumers / lambda functions.

There is no change in the code needed to activate enhanced fan-out.
