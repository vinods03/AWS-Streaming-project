Dynamic partitioning enables you to continuously partition streaming data in Kinesis Data Firehose by using keys within data (for example, customer_id or transaction_id) and then deliver the data grouped by these keys into corresponding Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) prefixes. 
This makes it easier to run high performance, cost-efficient analytics on streaming data in Amazon S3 using various services such as Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, and Amazon QuickSight. 
In addition, AWS Glue can perform more sophisticated extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs after the dynamically partitioned streaming data is delivered to Amazon S3, in use-cases where additional processing is required.

Note that, dynamic partitioning needs to be enabled at the time of creating the firehose itself.
This feature cannot be added at a later stage.
