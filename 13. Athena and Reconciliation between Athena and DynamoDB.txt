Once Glue Crawler completes, you can query the S3 data using Athena.
You can also cross-check the results between DynamoDB and Athena.
Note that DynamoDB has the details of every product in an order whereas Athena consolidates the data to order level.
The sum of (product price * product qty) in DynamoDB for a product must be equal to total_order_value in Athena.
