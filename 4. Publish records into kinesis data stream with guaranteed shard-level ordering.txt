Make sure ordering is maintained at a shard level for records published into kinesis data stream.
Refer Code\1. Producer\2. Publish individual records with guaranteed ordering for the code.

Note how the data dictionary compatible for inserting into kinesis is created first and then the sequence number is updated in the dict.
